Start working on data seeding(based on webflux/webclient)(maybe have option for admin to add recipe based on options from the mealdb)
Deciding on deployment options: render for hosting, aiven.io for database, cloudfare r2 for file storage(image)

1. What I have done / not done since last Scrum?
- Tried to run the project locally but ran into issues with UserRepository and security config.
- Discussed with Triet about starting small (main app + simple controller first).

2. What I plan to do from this scrum to next? (next 24 hours)
- Simplify the project to the smallest runnable Spring Boot app.
- Gradually add back UserRepository and JpaUserDetailsService.
- Watch tutorials on Spring Security basics.

3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out?
- Need to confirm with Triet if starting from a minimal setup is OK.
- Will share any useful tutorial links on Trello for easier follow-up.
